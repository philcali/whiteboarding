# Socketed Whiteboard Application

A learning exercise with nodejs, socket.io, express, canvas, and coffee-script.

## What works .... Sorta

- Image drag and drop: Put an image on there, and start drawing on it!
- Collaborative Drawing: Simple whiteboarding, or whiteboard as a team
- Works on an iPad: iPad people can only watch what's going down.

It is what it is. 

I will now leave you with a ridiculous drawing:
